# SCSInSCIBiophysicalModel

### Overview 

### Getting Started 

All simulations are run in NEURON. Instructions for setting up NEURON can be found (here)[]. Once installed, NEURON must be configured by running: 

```nrnivmodl mod_files```

The rest of the required packages can be found in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using `pip install requirements.txt -r`. 

### Scripts

This repository includes three scripts which are the generic versions of the main simulations included in Balaguer et al., 2025. A general description of these scripts, their use case, and the corresponding figure(s) can be found below. Information on the exact use of each script can be found in the function descriptions. 

- `record_mn_membrane_potential_supraspinal_scs_simulation`: 
- `run_mn_pool_supraspinal_scs_simulation`: 
- `run_fine_motor_task_simulation`:
